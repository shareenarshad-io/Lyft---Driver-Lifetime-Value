We would like to answer some questions after exploring and analyzing the data, questions are :
'''

# Import the required libraries
import pandas as pd # for data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np # for numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for data visualization
import seaborn as sns # for advanced data visualization

#Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).


#What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value?
#What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft?
#Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more value for Lyft than the average driver?
#What actionable recommendations are there for the business?
