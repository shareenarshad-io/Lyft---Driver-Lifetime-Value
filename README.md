# Lyft---Driver-Lifetime-Value
Lyft Data Science Project

After exploring and analyzing the data, please:

Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).
Please answer the following questions:
What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value?
What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft?
Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more value for Lyft than the average driver?
What actionable recommendations are there for the business?
Prepare and submit a writeup of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience.

This projects aims to answer these questions.
